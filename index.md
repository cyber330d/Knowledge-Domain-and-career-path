## COMPUTER<COMPUTING
Combining all the other sectors I.e
- **communications and networking**
- **materials science and engineering**
- **genetics,evolution,health**
- **neural and cognitive sciences**
- **energy sources,conversion,transmutation and utilization**
- To create computers and devices that can identify,authenticate, authorise access to humans and organism using advance energy signatures of the soul and body (bio energy,psychic,soul,spirit energy) and integrate with the human brain, mind and conscious directly to access a larger network that works  across large distances of light years and have a small size as possible maybe a chip into the brain or hand band or  maybe connect to a terminal or station port on a planet to connect to other planets with their conscious directly a second world in VR & AR
